# --- Local development: use NEXT_PUBLIC_* so the app can read them (or rely on /api/config). ---
# Deploy PrivateEscrow on Arbitrum Sepolia and set its address:
NEXT_PUBLIC_ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...

# Optional: DisputeResolver contract address (after deploying with deploy-dispute-resolver.sh).
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DISPUTE_RESOLVER_ADDRESS=0x...

# Chain: app uses Arbitrum Sepolia (421614) only. Optional override (must be 421614).
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=421614

# Optional: single RPC URL (default: Arbitrum Sepolia public RPC)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
# Optional: comma-separated RPC URLs for read-only fallback (avoids 429)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URLS=https://url1,https://url2

# CoFHE/cofhejs: LOCAL | TESTNET | MAINNET (optional, default TESTNET)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FHENIX_ENV=TESTNET

# --- Netlify (and server-only): set these in Netlify Dashboard (no NEXT_PUBLIC_). The app loads them via /api/config so they are never exposed in the client bundle.
# ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
# DISPUTE_RESOLVER_ADDRESS=0x...
# CHAIN_ID=421614
# RPC_URL=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
