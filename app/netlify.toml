# Deploy with: netlify deploy --prod (from app directory)
# Link site first: netlify link --name fhenixescrow (or create in Netlify UI)
#
# IMPORTANT: Your local .env is NOT deployed. Set env vars in Netlify Dashboard:
#   Site configuration → Environment variables
#   Add ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS (required) and optionally:
#   DISPUTE_RESOLVER_ADDRESS, CHAIN_ID, RPC_URL, RPC_URLS, FHENIX_ENV
#   Use these exact names (no NEXT_PUBLIC_). The app reads them via /api/config.
